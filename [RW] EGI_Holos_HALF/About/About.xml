Do you like to play high-tech colonies?
Do you enjoy the variety of the Ideology styles, but find them a tad limiting?
Do you want to plaster your base full of shining and brilliant displays, until your colonists retinas are as crispy as a potato strapped to the bottom of an incoming orbital bombardment?

You do? Then you are in luck today, fine fellow!
The wonderful EGI agents from our “Eyes and Ears” branch have been hard at work to bring you the next generation of holographic projection units.

Featuring 571 projections divided over 14 categories and 2 projector thrones with 16 individual styles, we are sure you’ll find something you enjoy.

Feel free to peruse.

Brought to you by
Elder Gods Incorporated, where we love our craft.


Our merchandise will be ready for construction once the “Holo-Projection” technology, building on “Advanced lighting” has been researched.

Once finished, you’ll be free to try your hand at creating a variety of projectors to start illuminating your colony in ways never before seen.


Each projector features 3 modes, passively affecting your colonists around them.

Recreation: increases the recreation of pawns around them
Education: teaches colonists a random skill
Propaganda: increases certainty in colony-beliefs

The Projectors behave similarly to normal standing lamps and can even be coloured in a primary and secondary colour of choice.

For those who like to enjoy quality education, the large projector also offers a tutoring Mode, when placed adjacent to a school-desk, regailing your children with recordings of leading experts in their fields.They may not be as efficient as one-on-one tutelage, but offer valuable free-time for full-time parents.


This mod will remove the holograms from “Vanilla Expanded Furniture - Art”, so this mod should be loaded after that.

The Propaganda option will not be available, if the Ideology-DLC is not present.

The grand projection throne counts as a VFE Empires Stellic throne.

This mod comes with the DDS version of the textures, meaning using Fish Performance or Graphics Settings+ is recommended for performance reasons. These two mods are the only two compatible DDS loaders, if anyone is using another let me know and I'll add it to the list.

Many of the holograms take inspiration from various wonderful mods on the workshop, or the glorious artwork of the talented artists on the Rimworld discord server.

Thank you very much to:
- The “Vanilla Expanded” series
- Elseud for his incredible mech-retexture, that he allowed me to use
- DetVisor for allowing me to include his magnificent, beefy pirate gun
- Inertial mage, as I have used his “Toxic Plants Expanded” mod as in inspiration for the plant tutor
- the magnificent folks in #mod-art, as they have all been a great help and motivation
- Thekiborg for converting the textures to the dds format
